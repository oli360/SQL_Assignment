# SQL assignment

This project was an assignement to test my SQL skills. To run the file plese download the whole directory and run the main.py file.
This project is based on database offerd by the Modern Art Museum, if you already have the database and want to run this project please indicate the location of 
the SQLlite databse in the SQL_Helper.py file.

If you cannot run the script an example output text out.txt is available

Thank you for looking at my work.
